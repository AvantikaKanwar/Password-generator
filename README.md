# Password-generator
A strong password generator is a compact yet powerful tool designed to create secure passwords that help protect sensitive data and online accounts from brute-force attacks. Typically built using Python, it leverages libraries like random and string to produce unpredictable combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Users can customize the length and complexity of the password, selecting which types of characters to include. The code checks for basic safety criteria—such as a minimum length or at least one selected character type—and then generates a password by randomly sampling from the allowed character set. For added functionality, developers might incorporate a simple GUI using Tkinter, allowing users to input their desired password length and view the result in a user-friendly window. This project serves as an excellent introduction to key programming concepts like string manipulation, input validation, and user interface design, while also reinforcing the importance of cybersecurity through practical implementation.
